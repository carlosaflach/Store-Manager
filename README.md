# Store Manager API

## Introduction:

Store Manager is my first RESTFul API developed during Trybe Web Development course. <br />
It is a sales management system in dropshipping format in which it will be possible to create, view, delete and update products and sales.<br />

During this project I was able to implement unit tests for all layers of the MSC model of software architecture. 
This practice ensures greater reliability and security in requests and responses returned to clients.
